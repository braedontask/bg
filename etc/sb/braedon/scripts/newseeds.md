# NEW SEEDS

*A and B sit adjacent at their dining room table. B leans in comfortably.*
*A is half-smiling at B who is waiting his turn to speak, but not quite listening.* 

**A:** yeah. she would say something like -

**B:** something like?!

**A:** something like -

**B:** like?!

*Smiling, A pauses and makes a tacit 'let me finish' plea.*

**A:** something like 'i like that boy. what's his name again?'

**B:** and she would say that to - 

**A:** to me!

**B:** to you?

**A:** yeah, me. 

*B shoots a skeptical glance.*

**A:** ok. well, also maybe to you.

*beat.*

**B:** unacceptable.

*B leans away in protest.*

**A:** yikes.

**B:** that is correct. i assure you that i will work my hardest to match
such energies.

**A:** why?

**B:** is there a reason im expected to respond calmly? 

**A:** ...

**B:** genuinely, ask me the question "what was your name again?". ask me and
remember we both definitely know each other. ask me.

**A:** i - 

**B:** well?

**A:** *sighs* what was your name again?

*B's face goes stone cold - he's frigid in the wake of his once-warm demeanor.*

**B:** why the fuck are you talking to me? is there any reason? *pauses for a second.*
go on, take your shit - there's no audience here. candidly, i only entertain the circus on 
tuesdays. why don't you pack up your shit and blow out of town. take your clowny ass and 
roll back in another week. in this moment, anything is better than being in the know that you respirate. i assure a unique identifier for me isn't something your gonna need. 


*cut to: trains are tumbling by individuals on the platform. the rattling echos in the warm*
*station air.*
